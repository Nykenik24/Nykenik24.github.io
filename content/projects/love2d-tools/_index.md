A series of Love2d utilities
{{< /lead >}}

> Love2d tools is inspired by [batteries.lua](https://github.com/1bardesign/batteries/).

**Love2d tools** *(or love2d-tools)* is a series of **[LOVE2D game framework](https://love2d.org)** utilities to make developing games with Love2d easier and faster. It can make your game developing
experience a little bit better by providing useful tools that almost every game engine has (or not!), but Love2d lacks off.\
\
It comes with OOP, Timers, a Debugging helper, etc. All modules can be seen in [the repository](https://github.com/Nykenik24/love2d-tools/blob/main/README.md#made-modules).
> note: Love2d tools is **NOT** perfect, and you should know that bugs can occur and that it is currently **Work In Progress**.
