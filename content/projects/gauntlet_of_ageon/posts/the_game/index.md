Overview of "Gauntlet of Ageon".
{{< /lead >}}


## Overview.
Gauntlet of Ageon *(a.k.a GoA)* is a **dungeon crawler, roguelike** game.\
\
It is being developed in the lua game framework ["Love2d"](https://love2d.org), with sprites made in [Aseprite](https://aseprite.io)
and music made in ["Bosca Ceoil Blue"](https://yurisizov.itch.io/boscaceoil-blue). The game is still in a very raw state *(02/12/2024 18:19:32)* and is being developed only by me.\
\
The source code will be avaliable in github under the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/license/mit) for anyone to use the code for learning, modding or inspiring purposes. 

## Posts.
Posts about the game in this blog are going to be common while developing main features. Sometimes there are going to be a lot of posts, sometimes only one post per week *(or even month!)*.\
\
Posts can be:
- [Devlogs](#devlogs).
- Just a little bit of talking about the game.
- Problems in development.
- Announcements.

## Development.
The development of the game is going to be **hard**.\
\
With this i want to say that you **should not expect the game coming out soon and without bugs and problems**. I will release alphas and betas of the game: Alphas being on a raw, not polished state;
and betas being in a more playable state, with test and feedback purposes.\
\
I am very excited with the development and with the game in general, so any feedback you have is **very**, and i say **very** useful.

## Devlogs.
Devlogs are going to be the classic *"I added MOVEMENT to my INDIE GAME! | Devlog 5"* style posts *(and maybe videos?)*. Just used to register new features and share them to receive feedback
and having a way to come back and **remember what i release and when**.

## Expectations and future.
I have **two things to say about what i expect from the game**:
### 1. I don't think it will be revolutionary or a masterpiece.
**The game will be simple**, i am not planning on making a *Visual and interactive indie masterpiece*, but i'm also not planning to make a *slop, trash, fast-made game*.
The game will be... A game. A game that you can play for fun, and i emphasize **fun**, because i only want to make it fun. As i talked [here](#overview), the game will
be free, so i don't make any real profit from it. It will also be open-source, so you can learn from it, or even mod it. Then take to account that 
[this is my first real game](#2-this-is-my-first-real-and-public-game).

### 2. This is my first real and public game.
This means i don't expect a good release, is my first jump into actually having a game that others can play freely. I will try to make a good release, but don't think it is going to 
be easy.

## Inspiration.
This game wouldn't be possible without the help of this people:
- [JuniperDev](https://www.youtube.com/@JuniperDev) *specially for [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eK26atXTds)*
- [Pirate Software](https://www.youtube.com/@PirateSoftware)
\
They helped me finally decide to make a game. Without them this post wouldn't exist, Gauntlet of Ageon would never be made and i would be making more trashy games.
